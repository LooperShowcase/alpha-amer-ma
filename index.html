          The horse (Equus ferus caballus)[2][3] is a domesticated, one-toed,
          hoofed mammal. It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of
          two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has evolved over the
          past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus,
          into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating
          horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been
          widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are
          domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as
          feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this
          term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated. There
          is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related
          concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors,
          markings, breeds, locomotion and behavior.
